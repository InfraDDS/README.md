# Infrastracture for Dynamic Device Scaling(InfraDDS) Project Vision Statement

The objective of the InfraDDS initiative is to foster a community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for next generation architectures and frameworks based on Composable Disaggregated Infrastracture technologies.

# InfraDDS Project Goals
- Create community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for DPU/IPU-like technologies
- Create vendor agnostic framework and architecture for Composable Disaggregate Infrastracture-based software stacks
- Reuse existing or define a set of new common APIs for Composable Disaggregate Infrastracture technologies when required
- Provide implementation examples to validate the architectures/APIs
