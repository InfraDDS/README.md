# Infrastracture for Dynamic Device Scaling(InfraDDS) project vision statement

The objective of the InfraDDS initiative is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks based on Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI) technologies.

# InfraDDS Project Goals
- Create community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for CDI-like technologies
- Create vendor agnostic framework and architecture for CDI-based software stacks
- Reuse existing or define a set of new common APIs for CDI-like technologies when required
- Provide implementation examples to validate the architectures/APIs
