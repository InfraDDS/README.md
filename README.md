# Infrastracture for Dynamic Device Scaling(InfraDDS) project vision statement

The objective of the InfraDDS initiative is to foster a community-driven, standards-based open ecosystem for next-generation architectures and frameworks based on Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure technology.
Composable Disaggregated Infrastructure (CDI) is a technology that allows data center operators to achieve the cost, availability, and sustainability benefits of disaggregated cloud computing using on-premises equipment.

There is a whitespace between Kubernetes and the CDI systems that challenges more dynamic composability to meet the Kubernetes cloud-native environment.

This InfraDDS project will address this whitespace and will work with the Dynamic Resource Allocation project, Auto-scaler project, and Scheduler project.

# InfraDDS Project Goals
- Create community-driven standards-based open ecosystem for the CDI-like technologies
- Create vendor agnostic framework and architecture for the CDI-based software stacks
- Reuse existing or define a set of new common APIs for the CDI-like technologies when required
- Provide implementation examples to validate the architectures/APIs
